A customization of @bfields's [openwrt-recording](https://github.com/bfields/openwrt-recording#readme) to be more generic and usable on any ALSA-backended system.

Planned changes:
- automatic interface probing (done, needs tuning);
- SD-card - NTFS - recording (done);
- raw2tracks automation & Windows port (done, needs testing).

**NONE OF THESE MODS ARE PUBLISHED YET.**
