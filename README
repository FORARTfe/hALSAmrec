I wanted to use my wireless router (a Linksys WRT3200ACM) to record all
channels from my mixer (a Behringer X18) with minimal setup required by
me: recording automatically starts whenever the router detects that both
the mixer and a USB drive are plugged in.

To do that I drop a one-liner script into /etc/hotplug.d/{usb,block}
that calls the run-recording script.  Then I use raw2tracks to take
turn the resulting raw file into 18 wav files.

Prerequisites, besides installing openwrt and configuring it, include:

	opkg install alsa-utils kmod-usb-storage block-mount kmod-usb3 \
		moreutils kmod-usb-audio usbutils perbase-time

I may have forgotten some others.

Back-of-the-envelope calculations say there will be about 3.5MB/s, which
I think most flash drives can handle.  That comes to about 12GB an hour,
and VFAT has a 4G filesize limit, so I'm using ext4.

It seems to work, but it's a bit of an ugly hack that's specific to my
hardware.
