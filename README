I wanted to use my wireless router (a Linksys WRT3200ACM) to record all
channels from my mixer (a Behringer X18) automatically with nothing
required other than plugging flash drive and mixer into the router and
turning it on.

To use this, you need to:
- install openwrt on your router
- also install: alsa-utils kmod-usb-storage block-mount kmod-usb3
  moreutils kmod-usb-audio usbutils perbase-time
  (and possibly others I've forgotten...)
- copy recorder to /usr/sbin
- copy initscript to /etc/init.d/autorecorder
- copy hotplug to /etc/hotplug.d/block and /etchotplug.d/usb
- /etc/init.d/autorecorder enable

Then, once it detects a flash drive and X18 are both plugged in, it
automatically starts recording.

After I'm done I move the flash drive to a linux machine and run
"raw2tracks" to output file to 18 wav files.

Back-of-the-envelope calculations say there will be about 3.5MB/s, which
I think most flash drives can handle.  That comes to about 12GB an hour,
and VFAT has a 4G filesize limit, so I'm using ext4.

It seems to work, but it's a bit of an ugly hack that's specific to my
hardware.

Note it assumes the flash drive will show up as the unique /dev/sd?1.
